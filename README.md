Project For College 

This is a project made by me for the discipline microprocessor programming (PM) and written in C.

The project consists of creating a factory where we can produce cars of 5 different brands, each car needs a quantity and a type of materials to be produced.
The production is done in 1 of the 5 stations but each station can only process 1 car each time so is possible there are 3 states that the car can be found (Waiting / Processing / Finished).
Each station performs different processes and each car needs 3 processes to be complete.
In the factory besides the option to produce cars it is possible to Show the Stock / Refill Stock / Statistics / State of the Factory and Skip time where the admin can Skip time to see the factory in operation.
Note the production of the stations is in function of the time necessary to be complete and the cost is the most economical possible.
At the end it is possible to save the data in files.


Note Obtained in the project was 20/20
